## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to obtain an access token and refresh token for the Spotify API, and an access token for the Genius lyrics API.

1.  Sign up for a Spotify account and create a new app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login)
2.  Obtain an access token and refresh token for your app by following the instructions in the [Spotify Web API Authorization Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)
3.  Sign up for a Genius account and create a new app in the [Genius Developer Portal](https://genius.com/api-clients)
4.  Obtain an access token for your app by following the instructions in the [Genius API Getting Started Guide](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1)
5.  Clone this repository and navigate to the directory where you cloned it:
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/username/song-lyrics-translator.git cd song-lyrics-translator`
    
6.  Install the dependencies for this project:
    
    Copy code
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
7.  Set the `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and `GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variables to the values you obtained in steps 2 and 4:
    
    Copy code
    
    `export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET export SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN export GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    
8.  Run the `song-lyrics-translator.py` script:
    
    Copy code
    
    `python song-lyrics-translator.py`
    

## Usage

The `song-lyrics-translator.py` script will identify the current song playing on Spotify, find the lyrics for the song, translate the lyrics to English if necessary, save the translated lyrics to a file, use the translated lyrics to train a natural language processing model, generate music based on the named entities extracted from the lyrics, and save the generated music to a file.

You can modify the script to do something else with the lyrics and the generated music, such as using the lyrics to generate images or using the music in some other way in your code.
